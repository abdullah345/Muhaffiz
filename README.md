# About Muhaffiz
The venture "MUHAFFIZ" is about security of a specific region or place that goes under the scope of a camera. Through this undertaking we will distinguish suspicious exercises like in the event that somebody endeavors to toss something inside the building. This action is detected by extracting features from frames and on these features Convolutional Neural Network is applied over these features. Another suspicious action could be on the off chance that somebody leave something (sack, bomb) in the region. This feature is done by object detection method using YOLO. Datasets of bags being collected and sent to YOLO for training.
